Coder, artist, maker. I create algorithms that create at [The Grid][0]. Web is my canvas. My current focus is on alternative interfaces to computer programming, hackable & sustainable structures and creativity exploration. This is a wiki-blog-portfolio hybrid where I collect thoughts, feel free to explore. I love to collaborate, please follow me and keep in touch by [Twitter][1] ,[Github][2] ,[Flickr][3],[Tumblr][4] ,[SoundCloud][5] or the old-fashion [Email][6]. Thank you for your visit.
