  Coder and artist. I create algorithms that create at The Grid. My current
  focus is on artificial intelligence, alternative interfaces to computer
  programming, hackable & sustainable structures and creativity exploration.
  This is a wiki-blog-portfolio hybrid where I collect thoughts, feel free to
  explore. I love to collaborate, please follow me and keep in touch by Twitter
  ,Github ,Flickr, SoundCloud or the old-fashion Email. Thank you for your
  visit.
