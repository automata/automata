We were working on a genetic programming algorithm to generate contours based on a given example.

Each line is a population ordered from best to poor fitness. Each individual have a _genotype_ (draw instructions) and a _fenotype_ (the draw itself).

It is interesting to see how individuals make clusters of similar contours evolving to a 'zig-zag' pattern.

Some contours resemble 1950's works by [Manfred Mohr][0].
