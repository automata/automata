# Chaos Communication Camp 2015

I went to CCCamp 2015 with The Grid / NoFlo / Flowhub team.

We hacked a bit on the rad1o and I stay working on Caliper, our image analytics pipeline.

We stayed at c-base village almost all the time. I met Henri's friend Rambo and started to work on some MIDI-to-Tesla coil software.

Lots of Club Mate and blinking LEDs.

Last night we were surprised by a storm and we had to evacuate the camp!

For the last two days in Berlin we went to the Hot Underground HQ at Solmstrasse. I had a really nice time hanging out with Nick, Hannes, Jon, Gold and Mo.
