Vilson Vieira received his BSc. in Computer Science at 2007 from University of Santa Catarina ([Udesc][0]) and MSc. in Applied Physics at 2014 from University of São Paulo ([USP][1]). Worked as data mining consultant for 1 year and a half. On this period began to teach programming courses at [Udesc][0].

His macro-areas of research include Creativity Exploration, Alternative Computer Programming like Flow Based Programming, (Electronic) (Algorithmic) Music Composition, Computational Creativity, Digital/Software/Electronic Art, Physical Computing and Artificial Intelligence.

Vilson also helped to create the [Brazilian Lisp User Group][2], the multimedia, systems & arts collective [MuSA][3] and the FLOSS development team [Lab Macambira][4].

He is a free software and hardware enthusiast, releasing his [projects][5] using open source licenses.

Recently working with [The Grid][6] team on [Noflo][7], [Flowhub][8] and [Meemoo][9]. With prof. Michel Hospital (UFSCar) on OvO Project. With prof. Luciano da Fontoura Costa (IFSC/USP) and prof. Gonzalo Travieso (IFSC/USP) on a computational creativity research.

## Short Bio

Vilson Vieira is a code artist and open source enthusiast. He helped to create MuSA and LabMacambira collectives and has been developing for Google, Meemoo, Mozilla and The Grid. He has researched computational creativity for University of São Paulo. Currently developing visual programming languages and environments like Flowhub/NoFlo and helping to create the AI behind The Grid.

## Academics
